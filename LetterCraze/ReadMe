Welcome To LetterCraze from Team Manganese 

To play the game, run PlayerApplication.java
To create custom levels,  run BuilderApplication.java

To unlock the next level you must achieve at least one star on the previous level 

Once you create a level with the builder application, exit the builder application and run the 
Player Application to play the level in the "Custom Levels" section. All Custom Levels are unlocked 
and can be played without any prior level being played. 

Run JUnit on the entire LetterCraze Project to see Code Coverage 

Hint: Level 6 Theme Level is challenging and "fun"
